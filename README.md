Installation
------------

Download the framework from GitHub with

Playing
-------

The game is actually quite simple to play, just navigate to the folder where The-Worm is installed and you are up and running !
Just click the "Start game" button.

The are some sound effects in the game, so be sure to have the volume of the speakers adjusted to a pleasant level.

The idea of the game is a worm that eats as many apples as possible, while the tail gets longer and longer.
You control the direction of the worm with left arrow key ( or the A-key ) and right arrow key ( or the D-key ) for turning to the left or right, respectively.
If you run into the border of the green field or the tail, the game is over.
The number of apples eaten, all times high of apples eaten for each session ( which is initiated at start and when reloading the page ) and the current tail length is displayed above the game field.

Good luck !
